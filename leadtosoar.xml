She has driven the achievement of tremendous sales goals - from $20M to $50M in 3 years. Escobar is co-founder of <a href="https://www.globalwomenfresh.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Women Fresh</a>, an organization whose mission is to leverage the talent of Women in produce to close the food industry’s gender divide by inspiring, connecting, and empowering women around the world.</p> <p><strong>Episode Quotes</strong></p> <p>“To go where you really want to go, you have to put the hours, you have to put the energy, the investment – financial and non-financial – and ultimately that takes determination, right? I mean you have to have determination, you have to be incredibly intentional about what your goals and your dreams are.” - Julie Escobar<br /> “Rock the boat. Ask difficult questions.” - Julie Escobar <br /> “Hope is not a strategy.” - Michelle Redfern<br /> “You need to understand how the company is making money. And when you are comfortable articulating – how does the company make money and how do you add value to that equation – and you can articulate that well in front of anyone... then I think that’s ultimately when you become someone critical in the equation.” - Julie Escobar <br /> “The advice given to women is so rarely around developing your business, strategic, and financial acumen. It’s so rarely about how to harness and point your ambition in the right way. It’s so rarely about unleashing their potential. It’s so often about their appearance. It’s so often about work-life balance. It’s so often about the very gendered things...” - Michelle Redfern<br /> “Absolutely, it is important to hit the numbers, and to hit the revenue and the profits, but at the same time it Is incredibly important to bring the team and to have an environment and a culture that you are supporting and empowering and mentoring the people behind you. Because if not, then it doesn’t really work. The company can be making millions and billions of dollars, but if everyone hates coming to work, it’s a nightmare for everyone”. - Julie Escobar <br /> “Putting your head down and your bottom up doing really good work is OK. But you need to also build those internal and external relationships.” - Michelle Redfern</p>]]></description>
